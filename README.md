# RockPaperScissors
First JavaScript Program Built From Scratch
Following along with the lessons from, https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors, and creating my first JavaScript program. The end result will be a game of rock, apper, scissors where the player is playing against the computer.
